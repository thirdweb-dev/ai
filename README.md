_AI Agents with Onchain Intelligence_

## üìñ Overview

thirdweb AI is thirdweb's comprehensive toolkit for blockchain data analysis, wallet management, and AI agent interaction with blockchains. It simplifies complex blockchain operations into three core components: Insight for data analysis, Engine for wallet and contract operations, and Nebula for natural language-powered blockchain interactions.

## üåê Features

### Insight
Comprehensive blockchain data intelligence:
- **Chains**: Multi-chain support and network information
- **Transactions**: Transaction analysis and monitoring
- **Blocks**: Block data exploration and metrics
- **Events**: Smart contract event tracking and filtering
- **Prices**: Real-time token price feeds
- **Tokens**: Detailed token information and analytics

### Engine
Core blockchain interaction capabilities:
- **Wallet**: Secure wallet management and transaction signing
- **Read**: Read operations for smart contracts and blockchain data
- **Write**: Transaction creation and contract interaction

### Nebula
AI agent blockchain interaction:
- **Natural Language Agent Action**: Completing blockchain tasks through natural language instructions

### Python SDK

#### Installation

```bash
# Install core package with all framework adapters
pip install "thirdweb-ai[all]"

# Or install with specific framework adapters
pip install "thirdweb-ai[openai]"    # For OpenAI Agents
pip install "thirdweb-ai[langchain]" # For LangChain
pip install "thirdweb-ai[agentkit]" # For Coinbase Agentkit
pip install "thirdweb-ai[goat]" # For GOAT SDK
# ... many more framework supported
```

See the list of [supported framework and installation guides](python/thirdweb-ai#install-with-framework-specific-adapters)

#### Basic Usage

```python
from thirdweb_ai import Engine, Insight, Nebula, Tool

# Initialize services
insight = Insight(secret_key=...)
nebula = Nebula(secret_key=...)
engine = Engine(...)

# Example: Create tools for AI agents
tools = [
    *insight.get_tools(),
    *nebula.get_tools(),
    *engine.get_tools(),
    # Or pick an individual tool from the services
]

# Example: Framework integration (LangChain)
from thirdweb_ai.adapters.langchain import get_langchain_tools
langchain_tools = get_langchain_tools(tools)
agent = create_tool_calling_agent(tools=langchain_tools, ...)

# Example: Framework integration (OpenAI Agents)
from thirdweb_ai.adapters.openai import get_openai_tools
openai_tools = get_openai_tools(tools)
agent = Agent(name="thirdweb Assistant", tools=tools)

# see python/examples for other framework integration
```
