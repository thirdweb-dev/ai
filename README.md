## üöÄ Quickstart

### Python

#### Installation

```bash
# Install core package
pip install "thirdweb-ai[all]"

# Or install with specific framework adapters
pip install "thirdweb-ai[openai]"    # For OpenAI Agents
pip install "thirdweb-ai[langchain]" # For LangChain
pip install "thirdweb-ai[agentkit]" # For Coinbase Agentkit
```

#### Basic Usage

```python
from thirdweb_ai import Engine, Insight, Nebula, Tool

# Initialize services
insight = Insight(secret_key=...)
nebula = Nebula(secret_key=...)
engine = Engine(...)

# Example: Create tools for AI agents
tools = [
    *insight.get_tools(),
    *nebula.get_tools(),
    *engine.get_tools(),
    # Or pick an individual tool from the services
]

# Example: Framework integration (LangChain)
from thirdweb_ai.adapters.langchain import get_langchain_tools
langchain_tools = get_langchain_tools(tools)
agent = create_tool_calling_agent(tools=langchain_tools, ...)

# Example: Framework integration (OpenAI Agents)
from thirdweb_ai.adapters.openai import get_openai_tools
openai_tools = get_openai_tools(tools)
agent = Agent(name="thirdweb Assistant", tools=tools)

# see python/examples for other framework integration
```
